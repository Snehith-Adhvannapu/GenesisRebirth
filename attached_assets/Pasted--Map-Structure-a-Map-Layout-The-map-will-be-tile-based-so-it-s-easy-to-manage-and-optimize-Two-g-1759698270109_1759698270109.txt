. Map Structure
a) Map Layout

The map will be tile-based so it’s easy to manage and optimize.
Two good choices:

Hexagonal grid → feels natural and strategic (like Civ).

Square grid → simpler to implement and lighter on performance.

For mobile, I recommend square grid first for optimization.

Initial map size for Update 2:

Start with 10×10 tiles (100 tiles total).

Expandable in later updates.

Each tile represents a zone of terrain.

b) Tile Types

Different tile types give variety in gameplay and influence building placement.

Tile Type	Effect
Barren Land	Base tile for Terraformers
Water	Boosts Bio Factory productivity
Mountain	Boosts Energy Extractor productivity
Forest	Natural BioMatter generation
Crater	Rare boosts; special upgrades unlocked

Tiles unlock gradually to give a sense of exploration.

c) Map Evolution

The map is not static. As the player progresses:

Tiles visually evolve (gray barren → green forests → glowing cities).

New tile types appear.

Terrain changes reflect player progress.

Example:
When the player reaches a milestone in BioMatter production, they unlock a Forest Zone tile which spawns automatically near existing Bio Factories.

2. Placement System
a) Structure Placement

Instead of auto-upgrades, players place buildings manually.

Basic rules:

Each structure costs resources (BioMatter, Energy).

Placement consumes the tile space.

Certain structures need specific tile types (example: Bio Factory must be near water).

Adjacency bonuses: placing a building next to another of a certain type gives productivity boosts.

Example:

Placing a Bio Factory next to a Water tile gives +15% BioMatter output.

b) Building Types and Effects

We can start with a few basic ones and expand later:

Structure Name	Function	Placement Restriction
Terraformer	Turns barren land into fertile ground	Only on barren land
Bio Factory	Produces BioMatter	Must be near water
Energy Extractor	Produces Energy	Must be near mountains/craters
Research Hub	Unlocks upgrades	Anywhere, but costs more if far from the Core Structure
c) Strategic Placement

Placement is not just cosmetic — it becomes a strategy.
Example:
A player might place Bio Factories in clusters near water tiles to maximize output rather than randomly.

3. Gameplay Effects of Placement System

The map + placement system changes idle gameplay:

Adds player agency (they make strategic choices rather than passively clicking).

Creates visual progression → the map becomes a living world.

Introduces meta-strategy → optimizing tile placement becomes a layer of gameplay.

4. UI & UX Flow

UI elements:

Map View → main game view.

Toolbar → shows resources, buildings, upgrades.

Structure Menu → list of buildings with costs, placement requirements.

Tile Info Panel → tap a tile to see type, bonuses, and possible structures.

Controls:

Tap tile → open placement menu or tile info.

Drag to pan map.

Pinch to zoom.

5. Long-Term Progression

Update 2’s placement system is just the start — it should evolve in future updates:

Map expansion → from 10×10 to larger maps.

New terrain types → volcanoes, alien zones.

Special events → meteor showers, earthquakes that change tile types.

“Mega-structures” → buildings that take multiple tiles and give huge boosts.

Example of long-term reward:

“When a player fills a certain percentage of map with structures, the planet evolves into a living biosphere — unlocking a permanent productivity bonus.”

6. Emotional Hook

The placement system should give a sense of terraforming progress.
A narrative voice (GENESIS or narrator) can comment during placement:

“Terraformer deployed… life stirs in the barren land.”
“A Bio Factory hums… water flows to sustain life.”
“Energy Extractor installed… the planet breathes.”
