1. Core Idea — Map-Based Structure System

Instead of showing buildings and upgrades in a separate menu, you’ll have an interactive world map where players place structures like Terraformers, Bio Factories, and Energy Extractors.
As the planet evolves, new zones open up for construction.

Why this works well

Visual immersion → player feels they are building an ecosystem.

More strategic → choosing where to place a building matters.

Keeps players engaged longer → they’ll check how their map evolves.

2. Map Design for Mobile

We need to keep performance light for mobile devices.

Key design choices:

Tile-based map (hexagonal or square grid) — similar to Civ, but simplified.

Low-poly art style with minimal texture resolution.

Dynamic LOD (Level of Detail) — only nearby tiles have high detail, distant tiles are simpler.

Lazy loading — only load map chunks the player interacts with.

Optimized animation layers — keep only essential animations for structures.

Example Map Layout

Starting Area → barren gray wasteland (Update 1 finish point).

Zones unlock gradually → more tiles available after milestones.

Special tile types → mountains (energy boost), rivers (BioMatter boost), craters (rare upgrades).

3. Gameplay Flow

Instead of a simple upgrade list, Update 2 introduces a placement system:

Player Actions

Spend BioMatter & Energy to build structures.

Place structures strategically on map tiles.

Structures generate resources based on location and adjacency bonuses.

Unlock new tile types and structures with progression.

Example Structures
Structure Name	Effect	Placement Rule
Terraformer	Generates BioMatter	Must be placed on barren tiles
Bio Factory	Converts BioMatter to advanced lifeforms	Must be near water tiles
Energy Extractor	Generates Energy	Must be placed on mountains/craters
Research Hub	Unlocks upgrades	Anywhere but cost increases with distance from core
4. UI & Controls

For mobile, controls should be intuitive:

Tap → place structure or open info panel.

Pinch to zoom → see details or overview.

Swipe → move map view.

Simple toolbar at bottom → shows resources, BioMatter, Energy, upgrades.

5. Progression System

Milestone Unlocks → as BioMatter grows, more map tiles unlock and new structures appear.

Visual Evolution → map gradually shifts from gray wasteland → green forests → cities of lifeforms.

Map Events → random events trigger (storms, new species emergence) to keep gameplay dynamic.

6. Optimization Tips for Mobile

Keep map grid size reasonable (e.g., 20×20 tiles max early on).

Use sprite atlases for structure art to reduce draw calls.

Use object pooling for structure animations.

Avoid heavy physics calculations — only simple placement logic.

Preload upcoming tile zones to avoid lag.

7. Emotional Impact

The map-based structure system lets players see their progress physically.
It gives a sense of "terraforming a world", making Update 2 feel alive.
When players see their barren planet turn into a thriving ecosystem, they feel ownership and pride.

💡 Idea for storytelling tie-in:
When a player places a structure, GENESIS can narrate something like:

“Terraformer unit placed. A seed of life planted. The soil will remember this.”
