Players can now expand their territory, unlocking new land tiles with unique features and introducing strategic resource management. This transforms the idle game into a deeper strategic experience — closer to a Civ-style progression.

2. New Features to Include
A. Map Expansion

Unlock new tiles beyond the original grid (start with +5 tiles in each direction).

Expansion costs resources (generated by idle gameplay).

Expansion opens up special terrain types:

Volcano (high energy/resource yield but unstable)

Crystal Fields (rare resource bonus)

Desert Plains (low yield but strategic location)

B. Resource Diversity

New resource types based on tile type.

Resource categories:

Energy (fuel construction/upgrades)

Minerals (structure upgrades)

Rare Crystals (special abilities or boosts)

C. Territory Management Menu

Accessible UI panel showing:

Total tiles owned

Resource production rates

Expansion costs

D. Strategic Bonuses

Building placement now grants adjacency bonuses:

Example: Placing a solar plant next to a desert increases efficiency.

Forests next to water give extra biomass.

3. Player Interaction Flow in Update 3

Player taps “Expand” button → expansion cost shown.

Player confirms → map reveals new tiles with special terrain.

Player strategically chooses where to place structures to maximize bonuses.

Idle resources start increasing faster → encourages continual expansion.

4. Story Integration for Update 3

Narrative theme:
"Your world is growing. Every expansion brings new challenges, new resources, and new potential. But beware — not all lands are easy to tame."

Possible flavor text for tutorial:

"The first step beyond your homeland is always the hardest. As you expand, new opportunities and dangers arise. Choose wisely."

5. Optimization Considerations

Only render expanded areas when unlocked.

Keep tile textures light & reuse sprites for multiple terrain types with color variations.

Keep animations minimal for new terrain tiles to reduce GPU load.
